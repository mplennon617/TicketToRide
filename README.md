# TicketToRide
One of the earliest fully fledged coding projects that I've worked on; decided to dedicate a personal GitHub repository to this as this project was quite dear to me. It was a team project for my High School Data Structures-esque class, in which we applied BST, basic Graph Theory, and Java GUI. The majority of the game logic and graph applications were done by me.
